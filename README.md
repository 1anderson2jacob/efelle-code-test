# efelle Creative employment test
This repo was created as a solution to a test I received when applying to efelle Creative.  Here is the [design image](https://github.com/1anderson2jacob/efelle-code-test/blob/main/efelle-code-test/efelle_construction.png) that was included with the test, and the [finished product](https://1anderson2jacob.github.io/efelle-code-test/).

## The prompt
Attached is a zip [file](https://github.com/1anderson2jacob/efelle-code-test/tree/main/efelle-code-test) with a completed design file (“efelle_construction.png”), as well as a folder of images and a text document of color and font resources. In a new GitHub repository, please create a new HTML/CSS web page to recreate the design as closely as possible. We aren’t looking for exact pixel-perfect matches, but the newly created page should match the design as well as you can. The included “readme.txt” has links to the three Google Font styles used on the design, as well as four of the primary colors used for HTML elements. All of the images on the design are also included in the “images” folder. Some additional notes:- Multiple commits are preferred so we can see your thought process during the build  
- The page should have simple mobile responsive styles (the main header navigation does not need a fully functional mobile menu popout)  
- Header element should be sticky and scroll with the user  
- Main banner should fill the screen height automatically (at any browser height)  
- Add hover states to header nav links, banner button, and service spotlight blocks- be creative!
